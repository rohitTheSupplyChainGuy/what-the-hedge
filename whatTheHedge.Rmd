#Insights corner: While per gallon price of the jet fuel shot at its peak after the 2007 financial crisis, it can be noted that the commodity price is volatile with high fluctuations. To eliminate this volatility in the price, we are trying to analyze the impact of hedging.
#Surprisingly, the consumption plot shows  a cyclic pattern of low and high consumption. Let's park its analysis for some other day and time.

#Insights corner: Just when we thought that we really have an amazing tool to counter the volatility, we come across the above grahps. In case markets fall and jet fuel prices shoot below the hedge, we pay more than the market value of the commodity.

#Conclusion: Hedging does not ensure profit, it isn't the purpose of it anyway. It should and must be used to infuse certainty. When hedged, the balance sheet of the company is immune to fluctations in the price of the commodity.
#Another interesting conclusion is the fact that during in either of the situations, hedging prices obtained from longer duration has worked better. Perhaps, taking an average of longer duration suppresses the impact of highs and lows.
